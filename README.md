# ROG Zephyrus G14 (GA402) Hackintosh 
Hackintosh for ASUS ROG Zephyrus G14 (GA402) 2022.

### ** 2024-02-15 : IMPORTANT NOTICE (FROM OP)**
I no longer own a G14 so this repository will not be updated. I have updated the repo to be as up to date as possible at this time.  
I'll be happy if someone fork this repo and take my work over.

### Not working / Problems
- BIOS version 315 or newer
  - The system became very unstable after updating to BIOS 315, I have to stay on BIOS 312.
- Radeon 680 iGPU
  - Probably never works, that's why I bought the laptop with dGPU.
  - Left USB-C DP alt doesn't work because of it's controlled by iGPU.
- Hardware LCD backlight brightness control
  - Only software control available with [MonitorControlLite](https://github.com/MonitorControl/MonitorControlLite).
- Keyboard backlight brightness control
  - Always on
- Keyboard Fn hotkeys
  - Only sound hotkeys work
- Longer battery life
  - Even in dGPU mode, Windows should run for 3 hours but it only runs for around an hour and a half in macOS.
  - In iGPU mode, Windows should run for 10 hours, but iGPU doesn't work in macOS.

## Configurations
### config.plist
